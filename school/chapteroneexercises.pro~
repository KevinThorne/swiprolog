%Exercise 1.2.1
% Includes 1 fact, 1 rule, 1 clause, 1-place predicate, predicate
% w/arity:2


thorne(kevin). /*yes, kevin is a thorne*/
name(kevin, thorne). /*my name specifying name(first name, lastname)*/

in_thorne_family(X) :- in_thornejohnson_family(X). /*Going from my entire family
to just my immediate family*/
in_thornejohnson_family(kevin). /*My immediate family specifying me*/


%Exercise 1.2.2
% Includes "fact that represents "in" as a relation between Atlanta and
% Georgia

state(georgia).
city(atlanta, georgia).

%Exercise 1.2.3
% Includes representing latitude 34 north and longitude 84 west as the
% location of Atlanta

longitude(west,east). /*Setting the definition of longitude and latitude*/
latitude(north,south). /*with this setup, we can actually say North 34, West 84*/
atlanta_location(latitude/1, 34, longitude/1, 84).

%Exercise 1.4.* is located in geo.pro
%and in the text file

%Exercise 1.5.1
% I dont think anything would happen, it would just be a simple variable
% change because X,Y,or Z are all the located_in(X y or z, state).

%Exercise 1.5.2
/* 6 ?- located_in(austin,X).
Correct to: "located_in(austin,X)"?
Please answer 'y' or 'n'? yes
X = texas .

7 ?- write(X).
_G574  <- practicly saying NOT texas
true.*/

%Exercise 1.6.2
% located_in(atlanta,usa). would be faster then located_in(austin,usa).
% only because the located_in(X,georgia). clause is first

%Exercise 1.6.3
% Prediction: it should come up with x = georgia or x = texas because
% those are the 2 that are with "usa" in the clause
%
% Outcome:  8 ?- located_in(X,usa). X = atlanta .



%Exercise 1.7.1
% asdfasdf = atom  234 = number  f(a,b) = structure  _on = variable
% X(y,z) = not valid  in_out_ = variable  'X'(XX) = structure
% 'X' = atom

%Exercise 1.7.2
% located_in (at lanta,georgia).
% Errors in the above include you cannot break up an atom and you cannot
% put anything between a functor and the open parenthesis


%Exercise 1.7.3
% The version of Prolog that we are using do not notify the spacing
% between the clauses for the predicate.
